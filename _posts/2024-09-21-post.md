<!-- excerpt start -->
This past week,  Jeanny Wang, MPH, presented research from our lab  at the 17th AACR Conference on The Science of Cancer Health Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minorities and the Medically Underserved in Los Angeles, California.
<!-- excerpt end -->
Her poster showcased our ongoing research describing how  patient-provider communication may impact first course treatment received among men diagnosed with prostate cancer from the [North Carolina Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP)](https://pcap.bioinf.unc.edu/). The research was conducted in collaboration with folks across UNC, from PCaP, and the ButlerPopSci group. Thank you to everyone who stopped by with insightful feedback and questions!

Congratulations team, and look forward to seeing you all next year in Baltimore, Maryland!
